This numerical value will give us the *slope of the tangent line* to $f$ at $w_0$. Note that $f'(w) = 2(w - 2)$.\n",

    "\n",
    "Observing the figure generated by the code above, notice that the tangent line implies a direction of descent. That is, at the point $(5, f(5))$, the tangent line has a positive slope. This indicates that we need move in the negative direction (to the left of $w_0 = 5$) if we wish to move to a smaller value of $f(w)$. That is, **we need to move in the direction opposite of the sign of the derivative of $f(w)$ at $w_0 = 5$**.\n",

    "### - But how far should we move? \n",
    "The value of how far to move in the opposite sign of the derivative of $f(w)$ at $w_0 = 5$ is called the **learning rate** (Nocedal & Wright call this *hyperparameter* the **step length**), and is typically denoted by $\\alpha$. The process of multiplying the derivative of $f(w)$ at $w_0 = 5$ by the learning rate and forming a new choice of $w$ by subtracting this quantity from $w_0$ is called **gradient descent**. For example, we may apply gradient descent at $w_0$ and form a new $w$, say $w_1$, with the following update:\n",
