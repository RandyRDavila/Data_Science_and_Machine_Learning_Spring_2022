    "Python strings are sequences of characters and symbols surrounded by ``` \" \" ``` or by ``` ' ' ```, and will be used in many contexts, such as when writing *doc strings*, printing descriptive output, and when naming the columns of tabular data (*DataFrames*). Strings are also often the first representation of data read into a program before being converted to numerical values (if needed). To illustrate how strings work consider typing the following code into the cell below:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# This is one way to define a string\n",
    "first_name = \"John\"\n",

    "\n",
    "**Tip 2.** This code is an example of **variable assignment**. Variable names must begin with a non-numerical value and should always be lower case. Also, it is standard in Python to use underscores to seperate words in variable names. \n",
